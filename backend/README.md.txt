## How to Run
1. Open `demo.ipynb`
2. Install required libraries if needed
3. Run all cells from top to bottom

## Input
- Audio file (e.g. WAV)

## Output
- SGV

## Notes
This is a prototype for a university assignment, focusing on demonstrating
the workflow rather than production deployment.
