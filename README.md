# SCORE-audio-transcription-demo
This project is a web-based tool that allows users to upload audio files, select an instrument, and automatically generate sheet music and tablature without manual transcription. It also recommends musically similar pieces to help users learn and explore music within the same style.
## Sample Input and Output

### Sample Input
- [`Cat Jump.mp3`](Vinzenz-Cat-Jump.mp3)  
  A short audio clip used to demonstrate the transcription process.

### Sample Output
- [`other.scroe`](page_001.svg)
  MIDI file produced from the transcription.

### Separate audio tracks
- [`other.mp3`](other.mp3)

# Team Contributions (Weekly Overview)

| Member | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 | Week 5 | Week 6 |

| Yunyi | Defined the core score-reading functionality and participated in backend architecture planning with Angxiao Xu. Clarified how score data would be processed and integrated into the system. | Worked on backend development with Angxiao Xu, focusing on implementing and structuring the score-reading logic and preparing interfaces for frontend connection. | Integrated code from different functional modules, organizing score extraction, prediction outputs, and backend logic into a unified structure. | Independently designed and implemented the frontend UI/UX, focusing on user interaction flow and score visualization. | Independently connected the frontend and backend, handling data communication and debugging request–response logic. | Conducted final integration and testing, fixed bugs related to score loading and UI responses, and prepared the system for submission. |
| Angxiao Xu | Worked closely with Yunyi on defining the core score-reading functionality and clarifying the system’s technical direction. | Collaborated with Yunyi on backend development, implementing score-processing logic and structuring the backend workflow. | Continued joint backend work with Yunyi, integrating functional components and organizing score extraction outputs. | Identified and finalised the required models and core programs and began consolidating system components. | Completed backend integration, tested system outputs, and identified and fixed bugs. | Participated in final integration and testing with Yunyi, debugging issues and preparing the system for submission. |
